## 💡 Potential Questions & Answers (PRACTICE THESE!)

### Technical Questions

**Q: How do you verify CUNY students?**  
✅ **A:** "Great question! I built a custom token-based authentication system. When someone signs up with a @cuny.edu email, my Node.js backend generates a unique verification token, stores it in SQLite3 with an expiration time, and uses Nodemailer to email them the code. They enter it, we validate against the database, and they're verified. I chose to build this from scratch rather than use Firebase Auth because I wanted full control over the verification logic and data."

**Q: What makes this different from Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace?**  
✅ **A:** "Three key differences: First, **verified-only community** - every user has a confirmed @cuny.edu email, so you know you're dealing with a real student. Second, **CUNY-specific features** - we understand student needs like textbook exchanges, furniture for dorms, campus-specific filters. Third, **built-in safety** - report system, verified badges, and because it's a closed community, there's more accountability. Facebook Marketplace is everyone - we're exclusively students, which creates trust."

**Q: Why SQLite3 instead of PostgreSQL or MongoDB?**  
✅ **A:** "Excellent question! For the current scale and deployment on Vercel, SQLite3 is perfect. It's file-based, zero-configuration, and incredibly fast for reads. For a student marketplace with thousands of users, it handles everything beautifully. That said, I architected the backend with abstraction layers, so migrating to PostgreSQL would take less than a day when we scale to tens of thousands of users. It's about choosing the right tool for the current need while planning for growth."

**Q: How do you handle inappropriate content?**  
✅ **A:** "We have a multi-layer approach: Users can report listings or messages with one click. Reports are stored in the database and trigger immediate email notifications to moderators via Nodemailer. Every listing is tied to a verified email, so there's accountability. If needed, we can suspend accounts. I'm also considering implementing automated content moderation using ML in the future, but for now, the verified community and report system work well."

**Q: Show me your code - walk me through the architecture.**  
✅ **A:** *Pull up VS Code*
- "Sure! Here's my API structure - I'm using Express with RESTful endpoints."
- "This is the email verification function - generates token, stores in DB, sends email."
- "Here's my database schema - users table with verification status, listings, messages."
- "Frontend makes API calls through this service layer for clean separation."
- "Everything is modular - easy to test and scale."

**Q: How do you handle security? What about SQL injection?**  
✅ **A:** "Security is critical. I use parameterized queries in SQLite3 to prevent SQL injection. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. Tokens expire after 15 minutes. I validate all inputs on both frontend and backend. CORS is configured to only accept requests from the frontend domain. For file uploads, I sanitize filenames and restrict file types. JWT tokens for session management with httpOnly cookies."

**Q: What happens if Vercel goes down?**  
✅ **A:** "Vercel has 99.99% uptime, but you're right to think about this. The SQLite database is stored in the repo, so it's version controlled and backed up. For production, I'd implement regular database backups to cloud storage. The architecture is containerizable - I could move to AWS, Railway, or any Node.js host in hours. The code isn't locked to Vercel."

### Business/Product Questions

**Q: What's your monetization strategy?**  
✅ **A:** "Right now it's free because students are price-sensitive. But there are several revenue paths: Featured listings where sellers can promote their items for $1-2. Premium accounts with analytics on listing views. Partnership with CUNY bookstores for textbook trade-ins. Even a small fee per transaction could work - if 10,000 students each make 2 transactions a semester at $0.50 fee, that's $10k per semester. But I'd validate what students will actually pay for first."

**Q: What's your user acquisition strategy?**  
✅ **A:** "Campus ambassadors. I'd recruit 2-3 students per campus to promote it. Flyering at the beginning of semesters when students need textbooks. Social media targeting CUNY-specific pages. Partnership with student government. The key is the network effect - once you get 50-100 active users on a campus, word spreads. I'd start with one or two campuses, prove it works, then expand."

**Q: How many users do you have?**  
✅ **A (if you have users):** "[X] registered users across [Y] campuses, with [Z] active listings."  
✅ **A (if you don't):** "I just finished building it and I'm starting with a beta at [your campus]. I'm doing user testing with 20 students next week to gather feedback before full launch. I wanted to make sure the product was solid before marketing it."

**Q: What if students don't show up for transactions?**  
✅ **A:** "Great point. Right now, that's on the users - like any marketplace. But I'm considering adding a reputation system where both parties rate each other after transactions. Users with low ratings would have badges showing their reliability. Maybe even a 'verified transaction' feature where both parties confirm the exchange happened. The verified email creates accountability that you don't get on other platforms."

**Q: How do you compete with Facebook Marketplace / OfferUp / Craigslist?**  
✅ **A:** "I'm not competing with them - I'm serving a specific niche they ignore. It's like asking how Poshmark competes with eBay - they don't, they focus on fashion. CUNYswap focuses on verified students. A textbook seller on Facebook Marketplace reaches random people; on CUNYswap, they reach 250,000 CUNY students who actually need that textbook. It's about targeting and trust."

**Q: What's your biggest challenge right now?**  
✅ **A:** "User acquisition without a marketing budget. I'm one person, and getting students to try something new is hard. My plan is to start small - beta test at my campus, gather testimonials, prove the value. Then use word-of-mouth and campus partnerships to grow. I'd love your advice on cost-effective student acquisition strategies."

**Q: What makes you qualified to run this?**  
✅ **A:** "I built the entire platform myself - frontend, backend, database, deployment. I understand both the technical and user sides. I'm also a CUNY student, so I know the problem firsthand. I've bought textbooks on sketchy platforms and dealt with flaky sellers. This started as a personal problem I wanted to solve. I'm not afraid to learn - I taught myself email integration, token authentication, and deployment for this project."

### Tough/Critical Questions

**Q: This seems pretty basic. What's special about it?**  
✅ **A:** "You're right that marketplace apps exist, but the execution is what matters. The verification system I built from scratch ensures safety. The CUNY-specific focus creates a community. And it actually works - it's deployed, functional, and solving a real problem. Most student projects are demos; this is production-ready. I'd rather have a simple product that works than a complex one that doesn't."

**Q: Why would students use this instead of free Facebook groups?**  
✅ **A:** "Because Facebook groups are chaotic - posts get lost, there's no organization, no verification, and it's hard to search old posts. CUNYswap is purpose-built for buying and selling. Everything is organized, searchable, with categories. Built-in messaging, photo galleries, listing management. It's the difference between using Slack vs. email - both communicate, but one is designed for it."

**Q: What happens when someone uses a fake CUNY email?**  
✅ **A:** "CUNY emails are issued by the university - you can't create a fake one. You'd need to hack into CUNY's system, which is way beyond the scope of buying a used textbook. The email verification ensures the email is real and accessible. That said, if someone loses access to their CUNY email after graduating, I'm considering alumni accounts with different badges."

**Q: Isn't this just another marketplace app?**  
✅ **A:** "At its core, yes. But that's like saying Instagram is just another photo app. The unique value is the verified CUNY community, the student-specific features, and the fact that it actually exists and works. I didn't try to reinvent the wheel - I built a reliable wheel for a specific use case that's being ignored."

### Questions to Ask Them Back

1. "What's been your experience working with student-focused products?"
2. "If you were a CUNY student, what feature would make you use this daily?"
3. "What's the biggest security concern you'd have with a platform like this?"
4. "Have you seen similar products succeed or fail? What was the difference?"
5. "What would you prioritize - more features or more users first?"
6. "Any advice on scaling from one campus to 25?"
7. "How would you approach getting the first 1,000 users?"
8. "What metrics should I be tracking right now?"

**Q: What are your next features?**  
A: In-app notifications, chat enhancements, advanced search filters, campus-specific feeds
