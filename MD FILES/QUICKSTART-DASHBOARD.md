## 💡 Pro Tip

Practice switching between:

Say: "Here's the marketplace where students find items... and here's our analytics showing platform activity."

This shows you built both the product AND understand metrics!

Your dashboard is ready. It's professional, it works, and it will impress at PitchFest.
